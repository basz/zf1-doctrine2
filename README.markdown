# Zend Framework 1 Integration with Doctrine 2

***This branch is an extension to the "master" branch. It shows how I setup a modular ZF 
project with integration to Docrtine 2. The modular setup is inspired by [Leonard Dronkers](http://www.sreknord.net/).***

This project demonstrates how you can integrate Zend Framework 1.10.X with 
one of the most popular PHP ORM framework, Doctrine 2.

The ZF 1 and Doctrine 2 integration work is done by Giorgio Sironi. I borrowed the source 
code from Giogio's [nakedphp](http://code.google.com/p/nakedphp/) project. 

The easy to use "Application_Api_Util_Bootstrap" class is the good work from [Leonard Dronkers](http://www.sreknord.net/).

As the author of this project, I take no credit in all the good work done by Giogio and Leonard. 
I simply put them together into a bare bone Zend Framework project. 

By putting this project on Github, I hope it could save other people some time in 
finding ways to integrate ZF 1 and Doctrine 2.
